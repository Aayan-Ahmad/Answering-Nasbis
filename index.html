      <h3>Muawiah's ruiling</h3>
      <p class="pTag pTagSmall marginTopPTag">
        It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abd Rabb
        al-Ka'ba who said: I entered the mosque when 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As
        was sitting in the shade of the Ka'ba and the people had gathered around
        him. I betook myself to them and sat near him. (Now) Abdullah said: I
        accompanied the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) on a journey.
        We halted at a place. Some of us began to set right their tents, others
        began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began to graze
        their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )
        announced that the people should gather together for prayer, so we gathered
        around the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He said: It was the duty
        of every Prophet that has gone before me to guide his followers to what he
        knew was good for them and warn them against what he knew was bad for them;
        but this Umma of yours has its days of peace and (security) in the beginning
        of its career, and in the last phase of its existence it will be afflicted
        with trials and with things disagreeable to you. (In this phase of the Umma),
        there will be tremendous trials one after the other, each making the previous
        one dwindle into insignificance. When they would be afflicted with a trial,
        the believer would say: This is going to bring about my destruction. When at
        (the trial) is over, they would be afflicted with another trial, and the
        believer would say: This surely is going to be my end. Whoever wishes to be
        delivered from the fire and enter the garden should die with faith in Allah
        and the Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by
        them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the piedge of
        his hand and the sincerity of his heart (i. e. submit to him both outwardly
        as well as inwardly). He should obey him to the best of his capacity.
        It another man comes forward (as a claimant to Caliphate), disputing his
        authority, they (the Muslims) should behead the latter. The narrator says:
        I came close to him ('Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As) and said to him: Can you
        say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )?
        He pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it
        and my mind retained it. <em>I said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu'awiya, orders
          us to unjustly consume our wealth among ourselves and to kill one another </em>,
        while Allah says: O ye who believe, do not consume your wealth among yourselves
        unjustly, unless it be trade based on mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves.
        Verily, God is Merciful to you (iv. 29). The narrator says that (hearing this) Abdullah b.
        'Amr b. al-As kept quiet for a while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to
        God; and diqobey him in matters involving disobedience to God. <br>

      <h3>Muawiah insulting Omar(AS)</h3>
      <p class="pTag pTagSmall marginTopPTag">
        Narrated `Ikrima bin Khalid: Ibn `Umar said, I went to Hafsa while water was
        dribbling from her twined braids. I said, 'The condition of the people is as
        you see, and no authority has been given to me.' Hafsa said, (to me), 'Go to
        them, and as they (i.e. the people) are waiting for you, and I am afraid your
        absence from them will produce division amongst them.' So Hafsa did not leave
        Ibn `Umar till we went to them. When the people differed. <em>Muawiya addressed
          the people saying, 'If anybody wants to say anything in this matter of the Caliphate,
          he should show up and not conceal himself, for we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father.
          On that, Habib bin Masalama said (to Ibn `Umar), Why don't you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?
          `Abdullah bin `Umar said, I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs while
          I was sitting and was about to say, <i>'He who fought against you and against your father for
            the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,'</i> but I was afraid that my statement might
          produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my statement might be interpreted
          not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise
          (for those who are patient and prefer the Hereafter to this worldly life). Habib said, You did what
          kept you safe and secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so).</em> <br>

      <h3>Omar(AS) calling Muawiah a disbeliever. <br>
        (Indirectly)</h3>
      <p class="pTag pTagSmall marginTopPTag">
        It was narrated from Ma'dân bin AbI
        Talhah that 'Umar bin Al Khattâb delivered a Khutbah one
        Friday, and he mentioned the
        Prophet of Allah and Abü
        Bakr. He said: "I saw (in a
        dream) as if a rooster pecked me
        three times, I interpret it that my
        death is near. Some people are
        asking me to appoint a successor,
        but Allah will not cause His
        religion or His K/ilafah, nor that
        with which He sent His Prophet
        to be lost. If death comes to
        me soon, then the Khilâfah is to
        be decided by these six men with
        whom the Messenger of Allah (SAW)
        was pleased when he died. <i>I
          know that some people will
          resent their choice. I have struck
          them with my own hands in the
          defense of Islam.</i> <em>If they do that
          (i.e. resent the Khalifa), then they
          are the enemies of Allah, of
          disbelieving and misguidance.</em> I
        am not leaving behind me any
        issue that is more important to
        me than Khalala. I did not
        consult the Messenger of Allah (SAW)
        about any issue more than I
        consulted him about Kalâlah, and
        he did not get annoyed with me
        for any issue more than he got
        annoyed with me for this, until he
        poked me in the chest with his
        finger and said: '0 'Umar, is not
        Ayat As-Saif,[21 which appears at
        the end of Sârat An-Nisâ',
        sufficient for you?' If I live, I will
        issue a decree that will be so
        clear that those who read the
        Qur'ân and those who do not
        read it will be able to make
        decisions concerning it." Then he
        said: "0 Allah, I call you to bear
        witness over the governors of the
        regions, for I sent them to be just
        and to teach the people their
        religion and the Sunnah of the
        Prophet , to divide the Fai'
        justly among them and to refer to
        me concerning any difficult
        matter. 0 people, you eat two
        plants which I find to be nothing
        but repugnant, this onion and
        garlic. I remember the Messenger
        of Allah , if he noticed their
        smell coming from a man in the
        Masjid, he would issue orders
        that he taken out Aoward (i.e.
        out of ghe Masjid) Al-BaqI'.
        Whoever eats them, let him cook
        them to death (i.e. till there is no
        more smell in them)."
        [1259] ( ... ) A similar HadIth (as
        no. 1258) was narrated from
        Qatâdah with this chain.

        not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be
        more dear to me than the red camels. I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )
        say about 'Ali as he left him behind in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk).
        'Ali said to him: Allah's Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children.
        Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to him: Aren't you satisfied with
        being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no
        prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly
        give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger, and Allah and his Messenger
        love him too. He (the narrator) said: We had been anxiously waiting for it, when he
        (the Holy Prophet) said: Call 'Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva
        to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory.

        Let us summon our children and your children. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )

        A man(i.e Muawiah its mentioned in <a href="https://youtu.be/GpTPJUkgelc?t=2246">Musnad Ahmad</a>) asked him: Do you think it a calamity? He replied: Why should I not
        consider it a calamity when it is a fact that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
        used to take him on his lap, saying: This belongs to me and Husayn belongs to Ali?
        The man of Banu Asad said: (He was) a live coal which Allah has extinguished. <em>Al-Miqdam said:

        He said: Yes. He said: I swear by Allah, I saw all this in your house, O Mu'awiyah. </i>

        Mu'awiyah said: I know that I cannot be saved from you, O Miqdam.</em>

        Khalid said: Mu'awiyah then ordered to give him what he did not order to give to his two companions, and gave a stipend of two hundred (dirhams) to his son. Al-Miqdam then divided it among his companions, and the man of Banu Asad did not give
        anything to anyone from the property he received. When Mu'awiyah was informed about it, he said: Al-Miqdam is a generous man; he has an open hand (for generosity). The man of Banu Asad withholds his things in a good manner.

      <h3>The people who have ill <br>intent against ehle bait</h3>
      <p class="pTag pTagSmall marginTopPTag">
        Abdullah Ibn Abbaas narrated that the beloved Prophet SallAllaho Alaihi
        wa ala Aalihi wa Sahbihi wa Baaraka wa Sallam said:
        ‘O Children of Abdul Muttalib, I asked Allah three things for you; that
        He keeps your hearts steadfast (upon Islam); that He teaches the Deen to
        your ignorant and illiterate and guides your astray, and that He make you
        kind, generous and affectionate to one another. <em>So if a man prays, standing
        between the Rukn and Maqam, and fasts but dies with malice(the desire to harm) for the
        Household(Ahle Bait) of Muhammad he has entered Hell.’</em>
